# Lorexicon‚Äôs Gamemaster‚Äôs FAQ

*Sharpen your quill, brave traveler ‚Äî- here lie the answers to your most pressing inquiries, seasoned with a dash of humor and a pinch of RPG flair.*

## üìú General

### **Q: So what does it do?**

**A:** Lorexicon is your enchanted grimoire, bound to the very heart of Foundry VTT. Whisper a simple phrase‚Äîor spin an epic saga‚Äîand it will conjure a fully realized Pathfinder 2e Actor before your eyes. With a flick of its arcane quill, it inscribes every stat, every skill check, and every tactic onto the page, perfectly tuned to your chosen level. When the ritual completes, a new creature or NPC springs to life in your ‚ÄúLorexicon‚Äù folder, its stat block gleaming, its portrait summoned, and its tokens ready for battle. No manual import, no tedious adjustments‚Äîjust pure creation at your command.

### **Q: It creates actors then, using AI?**

**A:** Indeed. Lorexicon channels the arcane currents of artificial intelligence to forge complete Pathfinder 2e Actors at your command. You whisper your prompt, and the AI creates a detailed background and GM notes, then inscribes every stat, skill, and ability... even a portrait -‚Äî then Lorexicon binds the finished creation directly into your Foundry world as a fully-formed Actor document, ready to use.

### **Q: That name, tho...**

**A:** Aye, it's incanted as 'low-REX-ih-KAHN.' Slice together **Lore** and **Lexicon**, and you‚Äôve bound a 'dictionary of lore' ‚Äî- the perfect grimoire for your Foundry. Truth be told, we tried a few dozen other arcane titles, but every worthy name was already claimed by other wizards. Thus we arrived at Lorexicon: a unique fusion worthy of its magic.

## üí∞ What Does It Cost?

### **Q: Must I pay gold to harness Lorexicon‚Äôs power?**

**A:** Fear not, intrepid GM -- Lorexicon itself bears no charge to install. All explorers of the forge may sample its magic with a handful of free creations each moon (month). Beyond that, a modest Patreon pact is required to replenish your allotment of conjurations.

### **Q: How do I pledge my support to the Guild?**

**A:** Simply voyage to our Patreon stronghold and select the tier that best suits your adventuring needs. Each tier grants additional monthly spell slots -- more creations, more glory! Your pledge sustains the Guild‚Äôs scribes and fuels ever-greater innovations in the arcane arts.

### **Q: Where can I view the tiers, prices, and limits?**

**A:** Seek the full slate of offerings on our Patreon page:
[Patreon.com/Fergusware/Lorexicon](https://www.patreon.com/Fergusware/Lorexicon)
There you‚Äôll find all the details -- tier names, monthly creation limits, and the gold required to maintain your legendary status.

*Embark upon your journey with confidence, knowing that whether you walk the path of the free scribe or rise as a grand patron, Lorexicon‚Äôs grimoire awaits your command!*

## üñãÔ∏è The Art of Prompting

### **Q: How vague or specific should my incantation be?**

**A:** Lorexicon delights in the mists of ambiguity. A simple whisper‚Äî‚ÄúA cunning goblin rogue‚Äù or ‚ÄúAn ancient forest guardian‚Äù‚Äîcan bloom into a tapestry of detail far richer than you might expect. Trust its creativity, and you may find surprises more wondrous than your own design.

### **Q: Will it heed my detailed directives?**

**A:** In most cases, yes. If you decree ‚ÄúLevel 5 fire mage with a staff of ember, Knowledge (Arcana) focus, and Slow (Enchantment) cantrip,‚Äù the Lorexicon‚Äôs quill will strive to honor each rune. Yet know this: even the most precise spells allow for a spark of improvisation. The AI may embellish or interpret your vision to keep the story alive.

### **Q: What if my prompt grows too long or labyrinthine?**

**A:** Lengthy scrolls of instruction can sometimes confound the arcane forge. When the ritual grows over‚Äêelaborate, the AI may wend its own path, weaving in unexpected threads. For best results, strike a balance‚Äîfocus on the essentials, then let Lorexicon fill the tapestry‚Äôs finer stitches.

### **Q: Can I demand exact abilities, feats, or statistics?**

**A:** You may petition for them, but know that the Lorexicon‚Äôs arcane muse values narrative over pedantic precision. Your specific requests‚Äî‚Äúgive me Sudden Charge and Power Attack‚Äù‚Äîwill often appear, but occasionally the forge substitutes akin talents or adjusts values for balance. Embrace the variance; it breeds freshness in your tales.

### **Q: How do I master the forge‚Äôs creativity?**

**A:** Treat your prompt as an invocation, not a blueprint. Name the soul or theme you desire, hint at its power and purpose, then step back. Lorexicon will sculpt the rest, blending your vision with its own enchanted insights. The result: Actors that feel alive, not just assembled.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization & Content

### **Q: Why do the creations have so many abilities? It seems like too many.**

**A:** We‚Äôve deliberately over-provisioned each Actor with a generous suite of talents‚Äîimagine gifting your adventurers a well-stocked armory rather than a single blade. This abundance ensures you, the GM, can cherry-pick the most evocative abilities to fit your story, rather than being constrained by a bare-bones template. Think of it as choice over scarcity: you‚Äôll never wish you had more options when crafting the perfect encounter. *If you prefer a leaner build, simply remove or ignore the extras‚Äîyour game, your rules.*

### **Q: Does Lorexicon understand prompts in languages other than English?**

**A:** Indeed! The Lorexicon‚Äôs arcane engine can decipher incantations penned in tongues beyond Common. Yet, for now, its quill faithfully scripts its replies in the Common tongue alone. Fear not -- behind the scenes our scribes have etched the runes for a truly multilingual grimoire. As our patrons‚Äô voices rise, we shall prioritize weaving full localization into both prompts and interface, letting Elven, Dwarven, and other dialects join the chorus of creation. Should you wish to lend your own quill to this grand endeavor of translation, dispatch a raven to our scribes and join the localization guild!

## üîí Privacy & Security

### **Q: What does the Guild know of me?**

**A:** Little indeed, adventurer. We collect only:

* Your Patreon user ID (a numeric identifier)
* Your Guild rank (Patreon tier)
  That is all we require to open the gates of creation to you. We do not track your email, name, location, or browsing habits.

Should you wish to sever your ties with the Guild, just click the little chain-breaker icon next to your Patreon login. Your account will be unlinked instantly‚Äîno questions asked, no lingering enchantments.

> ‚ÄúA wise mage keeps no more records than they can defend.‚Äù

### **Q: Do you have access to my payment information?**

**A:** Perish the thought! The Lorexicon's Guild is bound by ancient oaths (and modern privacy practices). We do not, cannot, and shall not gaze upon your coinpurse. Any payment details you entrust to Patreon remain solely within their keeping.

## ‚è≥ Quotas & Usage

### **Q: How do monthly creation limits work?**

**A:** Each tier grants you a number of creations per month (tracked by your account). You can spend these on generating creatures, NPCs, images, and other wondrous things through Lorexicon.

* If your job fails, you‚Äôre never charged.
* If you simply don‚Äôt like a result, it still counts ‚Äî but if something goes truly awry or you have recurring issues, just reach out to [Support](https://github.com/Fergusware/loreweaver-support) and we‚Äôll help.
* Unused creations do not roll over‚Äîwhen the new moon rises, your spell slots reset.
  Think of it like spell slots‚Äîplan your casting wisely!

### **Q: So just to be clear, I am *not* charged if my job fails?**

**A:** Never! If your spell fizzles or your rogue trips the trap, you won‚Äôt lose any gold -- or credits, in this case. Your usage is always displayed for you on-screen, as easily as checking your hit points before diving into a dungeon.

### **Q: Why _do_ some jobs fail?**

**A:** Even the most seasoned wizards can hit a stubborn spell, and our AI is no exception. Occasionally it simply refuses to cooperate -- tricks of the arcane, we suppose. When that happens, we beg your pardon and humbly ask you to submit again. Know that with each hiccup, we‚Äôre probing its hidden runes and teaching it new lessons, so the next summoning has an ever-better chance of success.

### **Q: What happens if I cancel a job?**

**A:** Canceling a job before it completes does **not** deduct from your monthly quota‚Äîthink of it as calling off the ritual before the final incantation. Your resources remain intact, and you can try again immediately. *However*, if cancellations become frequent enough to resemble mischief (dozens of aborted runs in rapid succession), the Lorexicon Guild reserves the right to intercede and guard against abuse.

## üí∞ Billing & Tiers

### **Q: What happens if my payment fails? Or if I change tiers?**

**A:** Fear not -- the Loreicon's magic is flexible.

* If your payment fails, your access to the Guild‚Äôs forges will pause, but no penalties shall befall you.
* If you resolve the issue, access returns as swiftly as a recalled familiar.
* If you change tiers, your quota will adjust within the hour -- no rituals required.
  For refunds, please consult Patreon‚Äôs scribes; we cannot issue them ourselves.

### **Q: Why do I have to log into Patreon?**

**A:** Great question! Most modules live entirely on your local map; they never leave your screen. Lorexicon, however, uses both client and server ‚Äî- to authenticate you via Patreon, track your monthly guild dues, and securely invoke our AI for you. That extra login ensures you‚Äôre truly the hero you claim to be.

### **Q: How do I get Free Tier access? Do I need to click ‚ÄúFollow‚Äù?**

**A:** No arcane rituals required! To gain Free Tier access (3 creations per month), simply log in with your Patreon account. If you‚Äôre an active patron, you‚Äôll receive your Guild rank benefits automatically. Clicking ‚ÄúFollow‚Äù is encouraged for announcements, but it‚Äôs not required for Free Tier access.

_Note: The Guild reserves the right to alter or remove Free Tier quotas at any time._

## ü§ñ Technical & Models

### **Q: What AI service do you use?**

**A:** We currently summon the power of OpenAI‚Äôs arcane engines. We‚Äôre also perusing tomes on Anthropic and Gemini and may grant you the choice of familiars (AI providers) in the near future.

### **Q: What model do you use?**

**A:** By default, the lean-and-mean **gpt-4o-mini**, balanced to keep costs down while still conjuring clever results. Higher-end models may become available as premium Guild upgrades soon.

### **Q: Can I bring my own API key?**

**A:** We‚Äôre deliberating that option at the council table. If lowering your personal cost is a quest you‚Äôd embark on, your feedback will help us decide!

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Retention & Recovery

### **Q: How long do you retain my creations?**

**A:** Your quest log (or job history) lives forever in our archives, while the conjurations (JSON and images) remain in our vault for **90 days** before we gently release them back into the wild.

### **Q: I accidentally deleted my creation. Can I get it back?**

**A:** Not automatically (yet), but our support scribes can assist. Visit our [Support Page](https://github.com/Fergusware/lorexicon-support) and we'll help recover your lost treasure.

---

## üéì Lore & Origins

### **Q: Where did you get the idea for Lorexicon?**

**A:** Funny you ask! It all began as a brainstorming session with ChatGPT, imagining how AI could level-up tabletop adventures. And thus, Lorexicon was born!
