# Loreweaver’s Gamemaster’s FAQ

*Sharpen your quill, brave traveler —- here lie the answers to your most pressing inquiries, seasoned with a dash of humor and a pinch of RPG flair.*

## 📜 Quotas & Usage

### **Q: How do monthly creation limits work?**

Each tier grants you a number of creations per month (tracked by your account). You can spend these on generating creatures, NPCs, images, and other wondrous things through Loreweaver.

* If your job fails, you’re never charged.
* If you simply don’t like a result, it still counts — but if something goes truly awry or you have recurring issues, just reach out to [Support](https://github.com/Fergusware/loreweaver-support) and we’ll help.
* Unused creations do not roll over—when the new moon rises, your spell slots reset.
  Think of it like spell slots—plan your casting wisely!

### **Q: So just to be clear, I am *not* charged if my job fails?**

Never! If your spell fizzles or your rogue trips the trap, you won’t lose any gold -- or credits, in this case. Your usage is always displayed for you on-screen, as easily as checking your hit points before diving into a dungeon.

### **Q: What happens if I cancel a job?**

Canceling a job before it completes does **not** deduct from your monthly quota—think of it as calling off the ritual before the final incantation. Your resources remain intact, and you can try again immediately.
*However*, if cancellations become frequent enough to resemble mischief (dozens of aborted runs in rapid succession), the Guild of Loreweavers reserves the right to intercede and guard against abuse.

## 🛠️ Customization & Content

### **Q: Why do the creations have so many abilities? It seems like too many.**

We’ve deliberately over-provisioned each Actor with a generous suite of talents—imagine gifting your adventurers a well-stocked armory rather than a single blade. This abundance ensures you, the GM, can cherry-pick the most evocative abilities to fit your story, rather than being constrained by a bare-bones template. Think of it as choice over scarcity: you’ll never wish you had more options when crafting the perfect encounter.
*If you prefer a leaner build, simply remove or ignore the extras—your game, your rules.*

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **Q: What does the Guild know of me?**

Little indeed, adventurer. We collect only:

* Your Patreon user ID (a numeric identifier)
* Your Guild rank (Patreon tier)
  That is all we require to open the gates of creation to you. We do not track your email, name, location, or browsing habits.

> “A wise mage keeps no more records than they can defend.”

### **Q: Do you have access to my payment information?**

Perish the thought! The Loreweaver’s Guild is bound by ancient oaths (and modern privacy practices). We do not, cannot, and shall not gaze upon your coinpurse. Any payment details you entrust to Patreon remain solely within their keeping.

## 💰 Billing & Tiers

### **Q: What happens if my payment fails? Or if I change tiers?**

Fear not -- the Loreweaver’s magic is flexible.

* If your payment fails, your access to the Guild’s forges will pause, but no penalties shall befall you.
* If you resolve the issue, access returns as swiftly as a recalled familiar.
* If you change tiers, your quota will adjust within the hour -- no rituals required.
  For refunds, please consult Patreon’s scribes; we cannot issue them ourselves.

### **Q: Why do I have to log into Patreon?**

Great question! Most modules live entirely on your local map; they never leave your screen. Loreweaver, however, uses both client and server —- to authenticate you via Patreon, track your monthly guild dues, and securely invoke our AI for you. That extra login ensures you’re truly the hero you claim to be.

### **Q: How do I get Free Tier access? Do I need to click “Follow”?**

No arcane rituals required! To gain Free Tier access (3 creations per month), simply log in with your Patreon account. If you’re an active patron, you’ll receive your Guild rank benefits automatically. Clicking “Follow” is encouraged for announcements, but it’s not required for Free Tier access.

_Note: The Guild reserves the right to alter or remove Free Tier quotas at any time._

## 🤖 Technical & Models

### **Q: What AI service do you use?**

We currently summon the power of OpenAI’s arcane engines. We’re also perusing tomes on Anthropic and Gemini and may grant you the choice of familiars (AI providers) in the near future.

### **Q: What model do you use?**

By default, the lean-and-mean **gpt-4o-mini**, balanced to keep costs down while still conjuring clever results. Higher-end models may become available as premium Guild upgrades soon.

### **Q: Can I bring my own API key?**

We’re deliberating that option at the council table. If lowering your personal cost is a quest you’d embark on, your feedback will help us decide!

## 🗄️ Retention & Recovery

### **Q: How long do you retain my creations?**

Your quest log (or job history) lives forever in our archives, while the conjurations (JSON and images) remain in our vault for **90 days** before we gently release them back into the wild.

### **Q: I accidentally deleted my creation. Can I get it back?**

Not automatically (yet), but our support scribes can assist. Visit our [Support Page](https://github.com/Fergusware/loreweaver-support) and we'll help recover your lost treasure.

## 🎓 Lore & Origins

### **Q: Where did you get the idea for Loreweaver?**

Funny you ask! It all began as a brainstorming session with ChatGPT, imagining how AI could level-up tabletop adventures. And thus, Loreweaver was born!
