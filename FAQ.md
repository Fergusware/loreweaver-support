# Loreweaver’s Gamemaster’s FAQ

*Sharpen your quill, brave traveler—here lie the answers to your most pressing inquiries, seasoned with a dash of humor and a pinch of RPG flair.*

---

### **Q: How do monthly creation limits work?**

**A:** Each tier grants you a number of creations per month (tracked by your account). You can spend these on generating creatures, NPCs, images, and other wondrous things through Loreweaver.

If your job fails, you’re never charged.

If you simply don’t like a result, it still counts — but if something goes truly awry or you have recurring issues, just reach out to [Support](https://github.com/Fergusware/loreweaver-support) and we'll help.

Unused creations do not roll over from month to month (the Guild’s magic resets with each new moon).

Think of it like spell slots — plan your casting wisely!

---

### **Q: So just to be clear, I am *not* charged if my job fails?**

**A:** Never! If your spell fizzles or your rogue trips the trap, you won’t lose any gold—or credits, in this case. You can always inspect your current usage with the `/lw-usage` command, as easily as checking your hit points before diving into a dungeon.

---

### **Q: What does the Guild know of me?**

**A:** Little indeed, adventurer. We collect only:

- Your Patreon user ID (a numeric identifier)
- Your Guild rank (Patreon tier)

That is all we require to open the gates of creation to you. We do not track your email, name, location, or browsing habits (nor, if we're being honest, would we desire to do so).

*"A wise mage keeps no more records than they can defend."*

---

### **Q: Do you have access to my payment information?**

**A:** Perish the thought, brave patron! The Loreweaver’s Guild is bound by ancient oaths (and modern privacy practices). We do not, cannot, and shall not gaze upon your coinpurse. Any payment details you entrust to the shadowy vaults of Patreon remain solely within their keeping.

Our records know but two things: your valiant Patreon user ID and your Guild rank (tier). That is all we require to grant you access to the magical creation forges.

Spend freely, but fear not — no rogue hands here shall rifle your pouch!

---

### **Q: What happens if my payment fails? Or if I change tiers?**

**A:** Fear not — the Loreweaver's magic is flexible.

If your payment fails, your access to the Guild's forges will pause, but no penalties shall befall you. Should the issue be resolved, your access returns as swiftly as a recalled familiar.

If you change tiers, your quota shall adjust immediately. No rituals required.

As for refunds: the Guild is but a humble creator of tools, not a merchant of wares. Please consult the wise scribes of Patreon if you seek a refund, as we cannot process them directly.

---

### **Q: Why do I have to log into Patreon? I don’t have to do that for other modules!**

**A:** Great question, noble friend. Most modules live entirely on your local map; they never leave your screen. Loreweaver, however, uses both client and server—to authenticate you via Patreon, track your monthly guild dues, and securely invoke our AI for you. That extra login is our way of ensuring you’re truly the hero you claim to be.

---

### **Q: What AI service do you use?**

**A:** We currently summon the power of OpenAI's arcane engines. We're also perusing tomes on Anthropic and Gemini, and may grant you choice of familiars (AI providers) in the near future.

---

### **Q: What model do you use?**

**A:** By default, the lean-and-mean **gpt-4o-mini**—balanced to keep costs down while still conjuring clever results. Higher-end models may be available as premium guild upgrades soon.

---

### **Q: Can I bring my own API key?**

**A:** We're deliberating that option at the council table. If lowering your personal cost is a quest you'd embark on, your feedback will help us decide!

---

### **Q: How long do you retain my creations?**

**A:** Your job history (the quest log) lives forever in our archives, while the actual assets (the magic items--JSON and images--you craft) remain in our vault for **90 days** before we gently release them back into the wild. No JPEGs are ever harmed by our servers.

---

### **Q: I accidentally deleted my creation—can I get it back?**

**A:** Not automatically (yet), but our support scribes can assist. Send a carrier pigeon—or better yet, visit our [Support Page](https://github.com/Fergusware/loreweaver-support)—and we’ll assist in recovering your lost treasure:

---

### **Q: Where did you get the idea for Loreweaver?**

**A:** Funny you ask! It all began as a brainstorming session with ChatGPT, trying to imagine how AI could level-up tabletop adventures. And thus, Loreweaver was born!

---

### **Still have questions?**

If any mysteries remain, do not hesitate to send a missive! Our [Support Page](https://github.com/Fergusware/loreweaver-support) is always open.

The Guild's scribes will respond as swiftly as mortal limits allow (summoning a reply scroll takes time and we are few in number — we thank you for your patience).

*May your rolls be high and your creativity boundless!*
