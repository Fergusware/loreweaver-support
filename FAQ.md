# Loreweaver’s Gamemaster’s FAQ*

*Sharpen your quill, brave traveler—here lie the answers to your most pressing inquiries, seasoned with a dash of humor and a pinch of RPG flair.*

---

### **Q: Am I charged if my job fails?**

**A:** Never! If your spell fizzles or your rogue trips the trap, you won’t lose any gold—or credits, in this case. You can always inspect your current usage with the `/lw-usage` command, as easily as checking your hit points before diving into a dungeon.

---

### **Q: Am I charged if I don’t like the result?**

**A:** Alas, yes—you still expend your credit as if you’d looted a +1 sword. If this happens more often than a kobold ambush, please post a message on our [Tavern Notice Board](https://github.com/Fergusware/loreweaver-support).

---

### **Q: What information do you collect on me?**

**A:** Virtually nothing beyond your Patreon userId (a public numeric identifier) and your subscriber tier. No secret scrolls, no soul-binding rituals—just enough to know who you are and what benefits you’ve unlocked.

---

### **Q: Why do I have to log into Patreon? I don’t have to do that for other modules!**

**A:** Great question, noble friend. Most modules live entirely on your local map; they never leave your screen. Loreweaver, however, uses both client and server—to authenticate you via Patreon, track your monthly guild dues, and securely invoke our AI for you. That extra login is our way of ensuring you’re truly the hero you claim to be.

---

### **Q: What AI service do you use?**

**A:** We currently summon the power of OpenAI's arcane engines. We're also perusing tomes on Anthropic and Gemini, and may grant you choice of familiars (AI providers) in the near future.

---

### **Q: What model do you use?**

**A:** By default, the lean-and-mean **gpt-4o-mini**—balanced to keep costs down while still conjuring clever results. Higher-end models may be available as premium guild upgrades soon.

---

### **Q: Can I bring my own API key?**

**A:** We're deliberating that option at the council table. If lowering your personal cost is a quest you'd embark on, your feedback will help us decide!

---

### **Q: How long do you retain my creations?**

**A:** Your job history (the quest log) lives forever in our archives, while the actual assets (the magic items--JSON and images--you craft) remain in our vault for **90 days** before we gently release them back into the wild. No JPEGs are ever harmed by our servers.

---

### **Q: I accidentally deleted my creation—can I get it back?**

**A:** Not automatically (yet), but our support scribes can assist. Send a carrier pigeon—or better yet, visit our [Support Page](https://github.com/Fergusware/loreweaver-support)—and we’ll assist in recovering your lost treasure:

### **Q: Where did you get the idea for Loreweaver?**

**A:** Funny you ask! It all began as a brainstorming session with ChatGPT, trying to imagine how AI could level-up tabletop adventures. And thus, Loreweaver was born!
