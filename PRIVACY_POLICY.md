## Privacy Policy

"By my honor as a Loreweaver, I swear it to be true."

We collect no personal information beyond that which the Patreon system provides: your Patreon user ID (a number visible to you) and your current Guild rank (tier). We do not seek your true name, the location of your secret tower, nor the contents of your vault.

We shall never sell, trade, or otherwise profit from your personal data — we just want to build cool things to help you enjoy your adventures.

We collect no personally identifiable information (PII) from our users. We do not ask for, store, or share any data that could identify you.

If you have any questions about this policy, please reach out—but rest assured, we’re not tracking your data, and we have no plans to change that. Not now, not ever.
