# Loreweaver Support

_A public space for feature requests and support questions for Loreweaver._

## Project Overview

Loreweaver is an AI-powered companion module for Foundry VTT. Currently it is designed specifically for Pathfinder 2e Remaster. With Loreweaver, you can:

- Generate Pathfinder 2e Remaster stat blocks on the fly  
- Conjure custom creatures and NPCs as Actors  
- (Coming Soon!) Create immersive scene descriptions and artwork directly in the Journal  
- Produce token art and portraits without leaving Foundry  

Loreweaver integrates seamlessly into your GM toolkit so you spend less time on menus and more time telling your story.

> **Note:** The Loreweaver codebase is proprietary and hosted in a private repository. This public repo is dedicated solely to support, feedback, and community discussion.

See our current [Feature List](./FEATURES.md) and upcoming [Development Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md)!

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to centralize everything related to:

- **Feature Requests**  
  Have an idea for an enhancement or a new AI-driven tool within Loreweaver? Let us know here.

- **Support Questions**  
  General usage questions, troubleshooting help, or configuration guidance—ask them through Issues and we’ll respond.

- **Bug Reports**  
  If you encounter unexpected behavior, crashes, or errors when using Loreweaver, file a new issue describing the problem.

By keeping support and feature tracking transparent, everyone in the Loreweaver community can see what’s in progress, upvote requests, and follow along with fixes and enhancements.
